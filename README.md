## Testing
  * I tested the pages in different browsers including Edge, Chrome and Brave. 
  * I used devtools to confirm that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on different screen sizes. 
  * I confirmed that the form works: it requires entry at every field, the email field will only accept an email, the Tell me more button works. 

### Bugs
  * While testing I noticed the navigation links on the recipe page and join page did not work. 
  * I fixed this by correcting the code. 
  * On the joining page I had a hyphen by type="email" which I fixed. 
  * My link to the formdrop page I had typed .com instead of .net which has been fixed. 

### * Validation
* Accessibility
  * By running my project through lighthouse in devtool, I confirmed that the colours and fonts are easy to read and accessible.
